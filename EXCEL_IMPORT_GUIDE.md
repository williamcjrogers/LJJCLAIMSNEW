# Excel Import Guide - LJJ Deductions Breakdown

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Import data from "LJJ Deductions Breakdown 15.08.25.xlsx" into the hierarchical claims structure.

## ðŸ“‹ Options to Get Your Data

### Option 1: Export to CSV (Recommended)
1. **Open** your Excel file: `LJJ Deductions Breakdown 15.08.25.xlsx`
2. **Save As** â†’ Choose "CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)"
3. **Share the CSV text** - I can then parse and import it

### Option 2: Copy Key Data
Could you copy and paste:
1. **Column headers** from your Excel sheet
2. **First few rows** of data as an example
3. **Structure description** - how it's organized

### Option 3: Describe the Structure
Tell me about:
- **Heads of Claim**: What are the main categories? (e.g., SVP, BMS, Electrical, etc.)
- **Sub-claims**: How are they broken down under each head?
- **Values**: What financial amounts are involved?
- **Timeline data**: Any dates or events per head of claim?

## ðŸ”§ What I'll Do Once I Have the Data

1. **Configure the importer** for your specific column structure
2. **Map your data** to the hierarchical model:
   ```
   Head of Claim (e.g., SVP Systems)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Sub-claim 1 (e.g., Installation Failures)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Sub-claim 2 (e.g., Testing Issues)  
   â””â”€â”€ Timeline events for this head
   ```
3. **Import everything** into the master dashboard
4. **Test navigation** between master and individual heads
5. **Verify calculations** and totals

## ðŸ“Š Expected Structure

Based on the filename "LJJ Deductions Breakdown", I'm expecting something like:

| Head_of_Claim | Sub_Claim | Description | Amount | Status | Date |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|---------|--------|------|
| SVP Systems | Installation Failures | 28 defects identified | Â£890,000 | Active | 2024-01-07 |
| BMS Systems | Integration Issues | CPGS system failures | Â£400,000 | Active | 2023-08-12 |

But I need to see your actual structure to configure it correctly.

## ðŸš€ Quick Test

If you want to see the system working immediately, I can:
1. **Show you the interface** with sample data
2. **Demonstrate navigation** between master and individual claims
3. **Explain the structure** so you can map your data

Just let me know which approach you prefer!
